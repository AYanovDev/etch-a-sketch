# etch-a-sketch
The following is my 4th or 5th project that I do for The Odin Project. What it'll be is an html page that'll contain a configurable box filled with tiles that'll have an option to change color upon a click. After coloring the tiles a certain way, you'll have a chance to regenerate the box to be able to do it once again.

I'll need to:
1 - Create a flexbox div that'll contain a variable amount of tiles within (number x number). They have to be square shaped, centered, and have 1px of grey border, I think, to make them more or less distinguishable (at least for the testing purposes)
2 - Create a section in control of dynamically generatiing and regeneerating the pad. Complete with inout field to tell how wide the pad has to be
3 - Create a section with coloring controls. Just a bunch of circles with various colors that'll correspond to an appropriate marker.
